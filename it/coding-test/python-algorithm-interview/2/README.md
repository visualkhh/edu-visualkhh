#### https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters char[].  
Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.  
You may assume all the characters consist of [printable ascii characters]('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters').
